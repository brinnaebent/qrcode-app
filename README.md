# qrcode-app


I recently learned more about [QR codes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5ebcowAJD8). I use QR codes frequently in my classes but often run out of "free" QR codes on service sites like bitly. Watching this video on QR codes inspired me to build my own app around it since it is something I use a lot. 

This streamlit app is super simple and uses the qrcode library in python (see docs [here](https://pypi.org/project/qrcode/))

As a side note, I didn't use any AI to build this app - I wanted to go the "old fashioned" route of reviewing documentation for libraries. It was pretty cathartic building something without AI.
